# Intro to Artificial Intelligence
## *(From Search to Reinforcement Learning)*
---

This course explores the fundamental principles and algorithms that allow computers to exhibit intelligent behavior. Rather than focusing solely on static data, we focus on agents—systems that perceive their environment and take actions to achieve goals. We will progress from classical search and logic to modern decision-making under uncertainty, culminating in Reinforcement Learning.
